# Drug-Target-Interaction

**Predicting Drug-Target Interactions using a Genetic Algorithm**

---

## 📌 **Overview**

This project predicts **drug-target interactions (DTIs)** using a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** optimized and benchmarked against exhaustive search methods. The approach accelerates virtual screening and drug repurposing by efficiently navigating large chemical spaces.

## ⚙️ **Key Highlights**

- **Genetic Algorithm:** Evolves candidate solutions to find optimal drug-target pairs.
- **Exhaustive Search Benchmark:** Validates GA performance against brute-force methods.
- **Machine Learning:** Prepares and processes datasets for the GA.
- **SMILES Representation:** Encodes molecular structures as strings for chemical computation.
- **Application:** Speeds up early-stage drug discovery and repurposing tasks.
